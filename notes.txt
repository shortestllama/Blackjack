allow players to go back to each nested menu at the end of each hand

make all the dealer's stuff blue and each player have a different color and red for lose and green for win and gold for blackjack

IMPLEMENT SPLITTING

working on online game:
	bytes object formatting struggles
	new class Online_Player(Player)
		has a socket
	still just do everything based off of player objects in the player_list
		but now with Online_Player(Player) objects, we can use their socket to send and receive data in the same loops as before

(
when you start a server, display the ip address so that you can send that to your friends for them to join
WHY TF WOULD YOU MAKE THE PLAYER OBJECT ON THE CLIENT SIDE???
	Make the player object on the server side, just need to send over the name to make the player object
)

	got through the ready up and placing bets
	working on the dealing now
		print to myself
		send data to client
		dealer data needs to get printed AND sent to client
			socket magic???
			or just make an Online_Dealer(Dealer) subclass and give it the socket created in start_server()???

ask ChatGPT:
	why don't I have to do port forwarding when I play an online game on the ps4, for example???
